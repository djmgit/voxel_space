# Voxel Space

This is an attempt at implementing voxel space from scratch using Raylib. The player or the camera can move forward, rotate, lift up and down, tilt left, right, front and back.
I have also tried to add fog effect using two different methods.
The rendered worlds look something like this:

## What is Voxel space?

Voxel space is an old, extremely popular, first of its kind algorithm which was used for rendering pseudo 3D terrains. It was created by Novalogic developer 
Kyle Freeman (who also <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US6020893"> patented </a>) it and was used to create their signature game Comanche.
